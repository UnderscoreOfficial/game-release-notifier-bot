// Probaly should have a more universal file name since will be doing notifying updating etc alerts.
//
// 1. check added games to see if release date updated and if so update the release dates locally.
//  - if unable to get release date have an alert so the user can manually intervene.
// 2. check if the current saved release date is greater than or equal to the current date meaning the game is out.
//  - games should also have changes counting down to the release cycle these wont be notified but if a user checks the game or all the saved games
//
